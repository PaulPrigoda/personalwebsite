# personalwebsite
This was a final project I created for my Web Technology class. Our assignment was to create a website with everything we learned during the semester (this included HTML, CSS, javascript, b00tstraps, SQL, PHP, XML and more). I made a website to advertise I the music I make. Hopefully one day It'll go live. The only way to view the website is if you're running a localhost, but you are able to open up the "final.php" in any editor and take a peek at my coding.
